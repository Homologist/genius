        Kate Isobelle Furler (born December 18, 1975) or simply Sia, is an Australian
        pop and jazz singer and songwriter. Her mid-2010 international tour was cancelled
        with Sia citing extreme lethargy and panic attacks. She considered retiring
        from touring permanently until she was diagnosed with Graves'' disease \u2013
        an autoimmune disorder with an over-active thyroid. After resting and hormone
        replacement therapy, Sia resumed touring with gigs in Australia, the U.S.
        and Canada during 2011. Sia is the niece of singer-songwriter Colin Hay of
        Men at Work.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Sia started gigging in the Adelaide acid
        jazz scene and at the age of 17-years-old joined the jazz funk band, Crisp.
        The group released two albums, 1996\u2019s Word and the Deal and Delerium
        in 1997.\n\nBy 1997, Sia had left Crisp and as a trip hop artist, released
        her debut solo album OnlySee. It was produced by former Crisp band mate Jesse
        Flavell, who also wrote most of the tracks.\n\nIn 2000, Sia signed a recording
        contract with the Sony Music sub-label Dance Pool. While living in London,
        she performed backing vocals for Jamiroquai. In 2001 she released her second
        solo album, Healing is Difficult an eclectic mix of R&B and jazz, that was
        favorably received by critics. All the tracks were written or co-written by
        Sia and it was co-produced by Sia and Blair Mackichan. The album included
        the songs \u201cDrink To Get Drunk\u201d and \u201cLittle Black Sandals\u201c
        which became popular in U.K. nightclubs. The album\u2019s single \u201cTaken
        for Granted,\u201d reached #10 on the U.K. Singles chart in June 2000.\n\nUnhappy
        with the promotion of the album, Sia fired her manager, left Sony Music and
        signed with Go! Beat Records, a subsidiary of UMG.\n\nHer third album, Colour
        the Small One, was released in Australia and Europe in 2004. This downtempo
        album had Sia employing a mixture of acoustic instruments and electronic backing
        to her material. It featured \u201cThe Bully,\u201d which was a collaboration
        with American musician Beck. Two further songs were co-written with Beck and
        recorded, but have yet to be released. Colour the Small One spawned the singles
        \u201cBreathe Me\u201d and \u201cWhere I Belong.\u201d Six tracks on the album
        were co-written with her bass guitarist, Samuel Dixon.\n\nIn early 2005, Sia
        left Go! Beat Records, disappointed at the company\u2019s poor promotion of
        the album, and the failure of the label\u2019s U.S. counterpart to pick up
        the record. She relocated to New York City. Meanwhile, \u201cBreathe Me\u201d
        appeared on the series finale of the HBO television series \u201cSix Feet
        Under\u201d and the broadcast of the 2006 \u201cVictoria\u2019s Secret Fashion
        Show.\u201d The track had been licensed to Astralwerks and \u201cColour the
        Small One\u201d was given an American release by that label in early 2006.\n\nSia
        provided vocals for English downtempo group Zero 7 on their first three studio
        albums and has toured with the band. She is heard on their hit singles \u201cDestiny\u201d
        and \u201cDistractions\u201d from their 2001 debut album, Simple Things. Their
        second album, When It Falls appeared in 2004 and featured Sia voicing \u201cThe
        Shining\u201d and \u201cSpeed Dial No. 2.\u201d Their third album, 2006\u2019s
        The Garden, found six contributions from Furler, with two, \u201cThrow It
        All Away\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re My Flame\u201d released as singles in
        the U.K. and North America.\n\nIn 2007, Sia released a live album, Lady Croissant,
        in the U.S. It featured eight live songs from her April 2006 performance at
        New York\u2019s Bowery Ballroom. One new studio track, \u201cPictures,\u201d
        was included on the album.\n\nSia\u2019s fourth studio album, \u201cSome People
        Have Real Problems,\u201d was released in 2008 and peaked in the Top 30 of
        the Billboard 200 Albums chart. The album\u2019s featured singles included
        \u201cDay Too Soon,\u201d \u201cThe Girl You Lost to Cocaine\u201d and \u201cSoon
        We\u2019ll Be Found.\u201d Beck lent backing vocals to the songs, \u201cAcademia\u201d
        and \u201cDeath By Chocolate.\u201d\n\nSia approached Christina Aguilera\u2019s
        manager in 2007 to record \u201cDeath by Chocolate\u201d and Aguilera contacted
        Sia herself. During 2009, Sia and Dixon collaborated with Aguilera on tracks
        for the U.S. artist\u2019s sixth studio album, 2010\u2019s Bionic. Three of
        the songs were included on the standard version and a fourth was included
        on the deluxe edition.\n\nSia, Aguilera and Dixon also co-wrote \u201cBound
        to You\u201d for the soundtrack of the feature film, Burlesque, which was
        performed by Aguilera. \u201cBound to You\u201d was nominated for the 2010
        Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.\n\nIn 2010 Sia released, We Are
        Born, which was produced by Greg Kurstin and featured guitar from The Strokes\u2018
        Nick Valensi. We Are Born debuted at #2 on the Australian Albums chart and
        was Sia\u2019s first Top 10 release in her home country. The album featured
        a cover of the Madonna song, \u201cOh Father.\u201d\n\nHer latest album 1000
        Forms of Fear was released in 2014 and is her most successful album to date,
        with the top 10 single \u201cChandelier\u201d."},"name":"Sia","image_url":"http://images.rapgenius.com/de1b2bbca8e366211c986f5680e1c1dc.650x430x1.jpg","id":16775,"tracking_paths":{"concurrent":"/artists/Sia","aggregate":"/artists/Sia"},"url":"http://genius.com/artists/Sia"}},"meta":{"status":200}}'
